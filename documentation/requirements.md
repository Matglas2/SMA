## Project Vision

**SMA (Salesforce Metadata Assistant)** - A CLI-based tool to help troubleshoot and analyze Salesforce environments by querying metadata, automations, and code dependencies.

### Primary Goal
Save time during Salesforce troubleshooting by providing quick answers to metadata and dependency questions that normally require manual exploration through the Salesforce UI or metadata files.

## Evolution Timeline

### Phase 0: Initial Prototype (2025-11-08)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

Initial proof-of-concept with basic CLI functionality.

#### User Requests:
1. Created basic CLI application with Click framework
2. Added SQLite database for persistent storage
3. Implemented hello command as a demo feature
4. Moved quote storage from hardcoded list to database

#### Features Implemented:
- ✅ **Hello Command** - Greeting system with time-based messages, random quotes from database, and ASCII art
- ✅ **SQLite Database** - Local database at `~/.sma/sma.db` with automatic schema initialization
- ✅ **Quote Management** - Quotes stored in database, retrieved randomly, auto-seeded on first run
- ✅ **Development Workflow** - PR-based workflow with feature branches

#### Technical Decisions:
- Python with Click framework for CLI
- SQLite for local data storage
- Windows-first approach (cross-platform compatible via pathlib)

## Technical Stack (Planned)

### Core Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **CLI Framework:** Click
- **Database:** SQLite (local caching)
- **Salesforce Integration:**
  - Research: simple-salesforce, salesforce-python-toolkit, or pyforce
  - Salesforce Metadata API
  - Salesforce REST API
  - Salesforce Tooling API (for code analysis)
- **OAuth:** Research Python OAuth libraries compatible with Salesforce
- **Azure DevOps:** azure-devops Python package

## Database Design Requirements

### Metadata to Store
1. **Salesforce Objects & Fields**
   - Object API names, labels, types
   - Field API names, labels, types, references

2. **Automations**
   - Flows (Flow Builder)
   - Process Builders
   - Workflows
   - Triggers (Apex)

3. **Code References**
   - Apex classes and methods
   - Apex triggers
   - Field usage in code

4. **Permissions**
   - Field-level security
   - Object permissions
   - User/profile/permission set associations

5. **Dependencies**
   - Field → Automation mappings
   - Object → Flow mappings
   - Code → Field references

## Open Questions & Research Needed

1. **Salesforce Python Libraries**
   - Which library provides best Metadata API access?
   - Performance comparison for large metadata retrieval
   - OAuth flow implementation examples

2. **Database Schema**
   - How to model Flow dependencies efficiently?
   - Best way to store code references for fast querying?
   - Indexing strategy for autocomplete performance

3. **Azure DevOps Integration**
   - Authentication method for repository access
   - How to keep code in sync with repository changes?

4. **Autocomplete Implementation**
   - Real-time vs cached object/field lists
   - User experience design for large numbers of fields
